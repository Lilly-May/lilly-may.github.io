Hi, I'm Lilly!

I'm a Bioinformatics student at the Technical University of Munich.
Besides my studies, I'm working as a student research assistant at the Institute of Computational Biology at Helmholtz Munich.
Additionally, I'm currently writing my Bachelor's thesis in the Dynamical Inference Lab on hierarchical representation learning.

I'm interested in the intersection of biology and computer science, especially in the field of machine learning.
