Hi, I'm Lilly!

I'm a Bioinformatics student at the Technical University of Munich.
Besides my studies, I'm working as a student research assistant at the Institute of Computational Biology at Helmholtz Munich.
Additionally, I'm currently writing my Bachelor's thesis in the Dynamical Inference Lab on hierarchical representation learning.
I'm interested in the intersection of biology and computer science, and especially how we can use machine learning to advance our understanding in these fields.

In addition to doing research in this field myself, I aim to make the field more accessible to others. That's why I'm involved in the non-profit organization [KI macht Schule](https://www.ki-macht-schule.de/), where we teach high school students about artificial intelligence.
